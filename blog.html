                    <p>The differences between <strong>var</strong>, <strong>let</strong>, and <strong>const</strong>

                        Variables declared with <strong>var</strong> and <strong>const</strong> are scoped to the
                        immediate function body. <br>
                        Variables declared with the <strong>var</strong> keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the
                        variable can be
                        accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared. <br>
                        Variables declared with the <strong>let</strong> keyword are block-scoped, which means the
                        variables will have
                        scope to the immediate enclosing block.</p>

                    What is the difference between arrow functions and regular functions?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6
                        that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript
                        functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some differences between
                        them. Let's see the differences below: - <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Syntax: </strong> A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by
                            writing a few lines of code using arrow functions.</li>

                        <li><strong>Arguments binding: </strong>arguments object inside the regular functions contains
                            the list of arguments.The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn't define arguments i.e.
                            they do not have arguments binding.But you can easily access the arrow function arguments
                            using a rest parameter ...args.</li>

                        <li><strong> Use of this keyword: </strong> Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value
                            is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is
                            invoked. The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the
                            regular function's this behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword.

                            The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the
                            function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function
                            which means No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function
                            always equals this value from the outer function.</li>
                        <li><strong> Using a new keyword: </strong> Regular functions are constructible and callable.
                            They can be called using the new keyword. But, the arrow functions are only callable and not
                            constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</li>
                    </ol>

                    What is the difference between map(), forEach(), filter() and find() in Javascript?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p><strong>map(): </strong> map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a
                        new array with the updated elements.</p>
                    <p><strong>forEach: </strong> forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an
                        array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.</p>
                    <p><strong>filter(): </strong> .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a
                        certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>find(): </strong> Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they
                        differ in one small detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is
                        more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.

                        Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter .find(callback).
                        The parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array</p>

                    Why we should Use template literals?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line
                        strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called
                        tagged templates. <br>

                        Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most
                        commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders).
                        However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag
                        function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
